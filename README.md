## üîê About Upfile.1

**Upfile.1** is a privacy-focused, self-hosted file-sharing service that prioritizes security and ease of use. Files are encrypted end-to-end, allowing users full control over their data. Only users with the decryption key can access the files, ensuring robust protection even if the server is compromised.

## üåü Key Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: AES-GCM encryption ensures that files remain private and accessible only to authorized users.
- **Secure User Authentication**: Passwords are hashed and salted with bcrypt for enhanced security.
- **Admin Controls**: Includes IP banning, download throttling, and file size limits for robust management.
- **Flexible Theming**: Offers both light and dark themes.
- **Persistent Sessions**: Keeps users logged in for ease of access.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

</div>

1. **Client-Side Encryption**: Files are encrypted on the client-side using AES-GCM before upload. The user holds the encryption key and initialization vector (IV).
2. **Secure Key Sharing**: Keys are included in the download link as URL fragments, keeping them out of server access.
3. **Client-Side Decryption**: Upon download, the client decrypts the file using the key and IV from the link.

üõ°Ô∏è Security Details
</div>
End-to-End Encryption: Files are encrypted on the client-side using AES-GCM, and only users with the decryption key can access the files.
Secure Storage: The server only holds encrypted files. The encryption key never reaches the server, keeping user data private.
Authentication: Passwords are hashed and salted with bcrypt.
Download Throttling: Prevents excessive bandwidth usage.
IP Banning: Admins can ban suspicious IP addresses.
